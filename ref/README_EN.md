# Goal

The next space mission is just about to begin.
The goal is to establish a base on the moon.
Unfortunately our astronauts fled with our rocket.

NASA asks you to write a space mission management program.


# Steps

- Build a rocket able to host three astronauts.
- Hire three new astronauts.
- Put the astronauts into the rocket.

- Mission launch: in order to fly the rocket, astronauts must be able to
  swap seats. That's the only requirement. After all, flying a rocket
  is child's play.

- Free the astronauts and then fire them, we do not need them any longer.
- Destroy the rocket.
